        <h2>Web Developer</h2>
        <p>A web developer’s job is to create websites. While their primary role is to ensure the website is visually
            appealing and easy to navigate, many web developers are also responsible for the website’s performance and
            capacity. </p>

                verify the code works. Their
                responsibilities also may include managing access points for others who need to manage a website’s
                content.

                visitors see and interact with
                (also known as the user interface). They design the physical layout of each page, integrate graphics,
                and use HTML and JavaScript to enhance the site.
